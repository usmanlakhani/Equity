# The Setup

1. Downloaded Docker
2. Downloaded Nodejs
3. Used vite 5.0 to scaffold the project (npm create vite@5.0.0 .)
4. Installed Prettify to help with stylistic linting
   > npm install --save-dev prettier@3.1.0 eslint@8.54.0 eslint-plugin-react@7.33.2 eslint-config-prettier@9.0.0 eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y@6.8.0
5. Once Prettier has a configuration file (.prettierrc.json), configure the VS Code extension for it
   - I had to download the Prettier plug in through VS Code marketplace. The ==npm install== did not work
